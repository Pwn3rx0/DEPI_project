# 🛡️ DVWA Security Assessment
### *by Team Chain Slashers*

---

## 🔍 Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete **Web Application Security Assessment** of the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** while integrating **Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** principles.  
Our mission: identify vulnerabilities, strengthen defenses, and embed security into every stage of development.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To perform a structured **security evaluation** and **code hardening** of DVWA, applying industry-standard methodologies like **OWASP Top 10**, **STRIDE threat modeling**, and **secure coding practices**.

---

## 📅 Project Timeline  

### **Week 1 – App Setup & Threat Modeling**  
- Deployed DVWA in a secure lab environment.  
- Conducted **threat modeling** using STRIDE & OWASP methodologies.  
- Deliverables: Threat diagrams, asset mapping, data flow classification.  

### **Week 2 – Vulnerability Discovery**  
- Performed **dynamic testing** using **Burp Suite** and **OWASP ZAP**.  
- Identified critical vulnerabilities (XSS, Injection, IDOR, etc.).  
- Deliverables: Vulnerability list, exploit screenshots, and test cases.  

### **Week 3 – Secure SDLC & Code Review**  
- Integrated **secure coding practices** into DVWA’s source code.  
- Conducted peer **code reviews** and applied security mitigations.  
- Deliverables: Before-and-after code comparisons, SDLC policy draft.  

### **Week 4 – Reporting & Final Presentation**  
- Compiled a detailed **final report** including all findings, mitigations, and best practices.  
- Delivered a **presentation** showcasing secure coding walkthroughs and test results.
